Here are some useful userscripts i've written. Note that the license for each userscript, is specified in their respective file.

Old Reddit Focus:

-> Redirects reddit to old reddit

-> Removes all distracting elements, not necessary for reading questions and answers

-> Useful for only getting the required content from the post, nothing further
